## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
I’m a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with a strong interest in space instrumentation and hardware development. My work focuses on hands-on engineering, designing, building, testing, and evaluating systems that support scientific instruments, sensors, and spacecraft hardware. I’ve worked on multidisciplinary projects ranging from rover systems and optical sensing to quality-focused manufacturing and visual inspection workflows. I’m particularly interested in roles that bridge careful engineering practice with real-world mission needs, and I’m using my early career to build a strong foundation in instrumentation, testing, and hardware reliability for future work on space telescopes and satellite systems.
